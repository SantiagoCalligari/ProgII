these old letters from years ago i felt it was leading to a
when i wrote this letter i may have finally been able to address how it feels
another brickred room another blacktop town
another misspelled band burning their own houses down another pinebox tune to fill the cemetery dead
another star a touch of orange over purgatory gray another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
another song that runs too long god knows no one needs more misguided ghosts
more transparent hands to drop a nickel in our basket and well do our riot dance beneath another burning sky behind our painted lips in scores catatonic smilecovered anklebitten ships
so throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea as protection from the paperthin perfection you project on me when this repetition ends behind the window shades
a semiconscious sorrow sleeping in the bed ive made that most unrestful bed
that most original of sins and youll say thats what i get when i let ambition win again id hate to let you down so ill let the waters rise and drown my dull reflection in the naive expectation in your eyes back in a cast bitpart back when i felt most free
i had a butchers heart and no one thought they knew me so before the regiment resumes
before the dreaded sun appears
my drivers waiting so lets make one point crystal clear you see a floodlit form
i see a shirt design
im no savior of yours and youre no friend of mine youre no friend of mine
youre no friend of mine
im no savior of yours and youre no friend of mine you see a floodlit form
i see a shirt design
im no savior of yours and youre no friend of mine i see myself in the reflection of peoples eyes realizing what they see may not be even close to the image i see in myself
and i hate i might actually be more afraid
i feel like they know the story
i saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat twelve years ago i stood on the shore
jumped in and grab the coat and the river was rushing toward a waterfall
and my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land i let go of the coat but the coat wont let go of me
in any case please let me know if theres more i can give you if nothing comes of it then just know we are grateful
as if the first cut wasnt deep enough i dove in again cause im not into giving up
couldve gotten the same rush from any lovers touch but why get used to something new
cause no one breaks my heart like you
when you kiss me i wish we could see what happens next for a moment i could forget what happens in my head
if i doubt you would you come through happy second chance or happy ending
but this time you dont leave me sinking
im underwater no air in my lungs
my eyes are open and im giving up
you are the wave i could never tame
if i survive ill dive back in
as if the first blood didnt thrill enough i went further out to see what else was left of us
never found the deep end of our little ocean drain the fantasy of you
headfirst into shallow pools
and i wonder is it better to get it over with the illusion can shatter before we begin
if youre really sorry happy second chance think i could forgive
this time you wont leave me sinking
im underwater no air in my lungs
my eyes are open and im giving up
you are the wave i could never tame
if i survive ill dive back in
dive back into right back into
dive right back into you now i know you
now i know you now that i know you
dive right back into you back into
right back into you dive right back into you
now i know you now i know you
now that i know you dive right back into you
im underwater no air in my lungs
my eyes are open and im giving up
you are the wave i could never tame
if i survive ill dive back in
im underwater no air in my lungs
my eyes are open and im giving up
you are the wave i could never tame
if i survive ill dive back in
ill dive back in ill dive backas if the first cut wasnt deep enough
i dove in again cause im not into giving up couldve gotten the same rush from any lovers touch
but why get used to something new cause no one breaks my heart like you
when you kiss me i wish we could see what happens next
for a moment i could forget what happens in my head if i doubt you would you come through
happy second chance or happy ending but this time you dont leave me sinking
im underwater
no air in my lungs my eyes are open
and im giving up you are the wave
i could never tame if i survive
ill dive back in as if the first blood didnt thrill enough i went further out to see what else was left of us
never found the deep end of our little ocean drain the fantasy of you
headfirst into shallow pools and i wonder is it better to get it over with the illusion can shatter before we begin
if youre really sorry happy second chance think i could forgive
this time you wont leave me sinking im underwater no air in my lungs
my eyes are open and im giving up
you are the wave i could never tame
if i survive ill dive back in
dive back into
right back into dive right back into you
now i know you now i know you
now that i know you dive right back into you
back into right back into you
dive right back into you now i know you
now i know you now that i know you
dive right back into you im underwater no air in my lungs
my eyes are open and im giving up
you are the wave i could never tame
if i survive ill dive back in
im underwater
no air in my lungs my eyes are open
and im giving up you are the wave
i could never tame if i survive
ill dive back in ill dive back in

i cant call you a stranger
but i cant call you i know you think that i erased you
you may hate me but i cant hate you and i wont replace you
tell me how to feel about you now
tell me how to feel about you now oh let me know
do i suffocate or let go i think im tired of getting over it just starting something new again
im getting sick of the beginnings and always coming to your defenses
i guess its good to get it off my chest i guess i cant believe i havent yet
you know i got my own convictions and theyre stronger than any addiction
and no ones winning tell me how to feel about you now tell me how to feel about you now
oh let me know do i suffocate or let go
tell me how to feel about you now tell me how to feel about you now
oh let me know do i suffocate or let go
you keep me up with your silence
take me down with your quiet of all the weapons you fight with
your silence is the most violent tell me how to feel about you now tell me how to feel about you now
oh let me know do i suffocate or let go
tell me how to feel about you now tell me how to feel about you now
oh let me know do i suffocate or let go
you dont have to tell me
if you ever think of me i know you see me dancing
wildly in the fog of your memory you dont have to tell me
i can still believe
for all i know the best is over and the worst is yet to come
is it enough to keep on hoping when the rest have given up
and they go i hate to say i told you so but they love to say they told me so
i hate to say i told you so they love to say they told me
say they say they told me
say they say they told me you say you say you told me
i know you like
when i admit that i was wrong and you were right at least i try
to keep my cool when im thrown into a fire and they go
i hate to say i told you so
but they love to say they told me so i hate to say i told you so
they love to say they told me say they say they told me say they say they told me
you say you say you told me throw me into the fire throw me and pull me out again
throw me into the fire throw me and pull me out again
throw me into the fire throw me and pull me out again
throw me into the fire throw me and pull me out again
throw me into the fire throw me and pull me out again
throw me into the fire throw me and pull me out again
i hate to say i told you so
but they love to say they told me so i hate to say i told you so
they love to say they told me say they say they told me say they say they told me
you say you say you told me
