man you really know how to get someone down everything was fine until you came around
and ive been chasing after dreamers in the clouds after all wasnt i the one who said
to keep your feet on the ground man you really brought me back down
hold onto hope if you got it dont let it go for nobody
and they say that dreaming is free but i wouldnt care what it cost me
you got me tied up but i stay close to the window and i talk to myself about the places that i used to go
im hoping someday maybe ill just float away and ill forget every cynical thing you said
when you gonna hear me out man you really bring me down
hold onto hope if you got it dont let it go for nobody
and they say that dreaming is free but i wouldnt care what it cost me
reality will break your heart survival will not be the hardest part
its keeping all your hopes alive when all the rest of you has died
so let it break your heart hold onto hope if you got it
dont let it go for nobody hold onto hope if you got it
dont let it go for nobody and they say that dreaming is free
but i wouldnt care what it cost me

these old letters from years ago i felt it was leading to a
when i wrote this letter i may have finally been able to address how it feels
another brickred room another blacktop town
another misspelled band burning their own houses down another pinebox tune to fill the cemetery dead
another star a touch of orange over purgatory gray another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
another song that runs too long god knows no one needs more misguided ghosts
more transparent hands to drop a nickel in our basket and well do our riot dance beneath another burning sky behind our painted lips in scores catatonic smilecovered anklebitten ships
so throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea as protection from the paperthin perfection you project on me when this repetition ends behind the window shades
a semiconscious sorrow sleeping in the bed ive made that most unrestful bed
that most original of sins and youll say thats what i get when i let ambition win again id hate to let you down so ill let the waters rise and drown my dull reflection in the naive expectation in your eyes back in a cast bitpart back when i felt most free
i had a butchers heart and no one thought they knew me so before the regiment resumes
before the dreaded sun appears
my drivers waiting so lets make one point crystal clear you see a floodlit form
i see a shirt design
im no savior of yours and youre no friend of mine youre no friend of mine
youre no friend of mine
im no savior of yours and youre no friend of mine you see a floodlit form
i see a shirt design
im no savior of yours and youre no friend of mine i see myself in the reflection of peoples eyes realizing what they see may not be even close to the image i see in myself
and i hate i might actually be more afraid
i feel like they know the story
i saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat twelve years ago i stood on the shore
jumped in and grab the coat and the river was rushing toward a waterfall
and my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land i let go of the coat but the coat wont let go of me
in any case please let me know if theres more i can give you if nothing comes of it then just know we are grateful
as if the first cut wasnt deep enough i dove in again cause im not into giving up
couldve gotten the same rush from any lovers touch but why get used to something new
cause no one breaks my heart like you
when you kiss me i wish we could see what happens next for a moment i could forget what happens in my head
if i doubt you would you come through happy second chance or happy ending
but this time you dont leave me sinking
im underwater no air in my lungs
my eyes are open and im giving up
you are the wave i could never tame
if i survive ill dive back in
as if the first blood didnt thrill enough i went further out to see what else was left of us
never found the deep end of our little ocean drain the fantasy of you
headfirst into shallow pools
and i wonder is it better to get it over with the illusion can shatter before we begin
if youre really sorry happy second chance think i could forgive
this time you wont leave me sinking
im underwater no air in my lungs
my eyes are open and im giving up
you are the wave i could never tame
if i survive ill dive back in
dive back into right back into
dive right back into you now i know you
now i know you now that i know you
dive right back into you back into
